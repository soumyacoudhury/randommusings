# Hello Kotlin App

Right now this is a test app for me to practice vibe coding.

## Project overview
This repository contains small experiments and practice projects where I try out new ideas, frameworks, and platform-specific development techniques. The primary goal is learning through doing and maintaining short, focused test apps.

## Current Progress
I have set up the basic project structure and resolved initial build issues.

### First test: Hello Kotlin (Android Compose)
Instead of the initial Pong sample plan, I've started with a modern Jetpack Compose "Hello World" style application to learn modern Android development.

#### Features implemented:
- **Build Configuration**: Resolved manifest and namespace conflicts.
- **Theme Support**: Integrated local app theme (`Theme.HelloKotlinApp`).
- **Interactive UI**: 
    - Displayed custom text message.
    - Added a button labeled "Click Me".
    - Implemented click listener that prints "Button Clicked" to the console.

## How to get started
- Open the project in Android Studio.
- Build and run on an emulator or physical device.
- The main entry point is `MainActivity.kt`.

## Next steps
- [ ] Migrate the Pong sample idea into a Compose-based implementation.
- [ ] Explore persistent state in Compose.
- [ ] Add more complex UI components and animations.

## Contributing / Notes
- This is primarily a personal learning repo, but contributions or suggestions are welcome—open an issue or submit a PR if you want to help.
- I'll keep README updated as the project progresses.
