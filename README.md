Right now this is a test app for me to practice vibe coding

Project overview
----------------
This repository contains small experiments and practice projects where I try out new ideas, frameworks, and platform-specific development techniques. The primary goal is learning through doing and maintaining short, focused test apps.

First test: Android Pong sample
------------------------------
The first test in this repo is to create a simple sample Android app that implements a playable version of Pong. This serves as a compact project to learn or revisit core Android development concepts such as:

- Project setup with Android Studio / Gradle
- Activity and View lifecycle
- Custom drawing with Canvas
- Handling touch and/or simple keyboard input
- Basic game loop and timing
- Simple physics and collision detection
- Sound effects and basic UI for score/menus
- Packaging and debugging on device/emulator

Planned scope for the Pong sample
- A single-activity app with a custom GameView that draws paddles, ball, and score.
- Two-player local play (one device, split controls) or single-player against a simple AI.
- Pause/resume, restart, and simple settings (sound on/off, difficulty).
- Minimal assets (shapes and simple sounds) — no heavy graphics required.
- Clear, commented code to serve as a learning reference.

How to get started
- Open the project (once added) in Android Studio.
- Build and run on an emulator or physical device (min SDK will be specified in the module).
- Look for the pong sample module / package and run the main Activity.

Next steps
- Add the Android pong sample project into this repository as a module or under a directory named "android-pong".
- Provide build/run instructions and any notes about SDK/NDK versions, emulator settings, or known issues.
- Iterate with improvements (AI, polish, high score persistence).

Contributing / Notes
- This is primarily a personal learning repo, but contributions or suggestions are welcome—open an issue or submit a PR if you want to help.
- I'll keep README updated as the pong sample progresses.
